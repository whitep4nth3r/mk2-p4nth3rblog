      <p class="ai__text">Everything I publish on the internet — including this website and my newsletter — is created, built and written by me using my own thoughts, ideas, and experience.</p>
      <p class="ai__text">I may use LLMs and AI lightly as tools during the content creation process to help with things like summarising large transcripts or articles that I use as source material. Sometimes I use tools like GitHub Copilot to help me write code (but it's more fun and a better learning experience to write the code by hand).</p>
      <p class="ai__text">This website is my playground and my exploration space, and I like to painstakingly handcraft it myself.</p>
      <p class="ai__text">I have a strong dislike for AI-generated art and music. Whilst it may be a quick way to generate royalty-free assets for your project, it is devoid of imagination, creativity and the human spirit.</p>
